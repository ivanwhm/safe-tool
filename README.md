Scaled Agile Framework Tool
=============================================================================

This tool was created as a final work of my Agile Software Engineering MBA.

Currently, this tool has the following resources:

 - **User roles**: control of user roles to stories.
 - **Story status**: control of story status.
 - **Product owners**: control of product owners from each story.
 - **Products**: control stories to many different products.
 - **Epics**: control the epics of a product.
 - **Features**: control the features of an epic.
 - **Stories**: control user stories of a feature.
 - **Acceptance criterias**: definition of acceptance criterias for each story.
 
This tool was developed with this following resources:
